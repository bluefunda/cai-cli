## Authentication

CAI CLI uses the **OAuth2 device authorization flow**:

1. `ai login` requests a device code
2. Your browser opens the verification URL
3. The CLI polls for authorization completion
4. Access and refresh tokens are stored locally in `~/.cai/`

Tokens are refreshed automatically — you only need to log in once.

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from `~/.cai/config.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
# ~/.cai/config.yaml
endpoint: grpc.bluefunda.com:443
```
